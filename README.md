# grader_helper

## Next steps

Integrate the functionality that allows us to randomly select students from each gradeband and copy them to the moderation folders.
Integrate the way of making the departmental gradefile. 
Integrate the functionality that allows us to 'capture' the graderfiles and concatenate them into a single DataFrame.

Look into including some of the module set up functionality from other python modules. I've written.
