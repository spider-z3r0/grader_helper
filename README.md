# grader_helper

## Next steps

 - Integrate the functionality that allows us to randomly select students from each gradeband and copy them to the moderation folders.
 - Integrate the way of making the departmental gradefile. 
    - I've already got the functions that make the dataframes written, but not any explicit functionality for writing them into the departmental template. 
 - Look at the module and assessment set up functionality from the other modules.
