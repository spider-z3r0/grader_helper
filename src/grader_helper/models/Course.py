    Required fields
    ---------------
    name : str
        Human readable course title.
    code : str
        Module identifier used in files and systems.
    root : pathlib.Path

    Lifecycle
    ---------
    1. Instantiate :class:`Course` with the required fields.
    2. Attach supporting documents such as the handbook, class list and
       departmental grade file.
    3. Add one or more :class:`~grader_helper.models.CourseWork.CourseWork`
       instances via :meth:`set_coursework`.
    4. Mark each document and coursework item as ready.
    5. Finalise the course by calling :meth:`set_ready`.
